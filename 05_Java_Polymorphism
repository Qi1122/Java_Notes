1.This behavior is referred to as virtual method invocation,
and these methods are referred to as virtual methods.
An overridden method is invoked at run time, no matter what data type the reference is
that was used in the source code at compile time.

mailCheck() on e is quite different because e is an Employee reference.
When the compiler sees e.mailCheck(), the compiler sees the mailCheck()
method in the Employee class.

Here, at compile time, the compiler used mailCheck() in Employee to validate this statement.
At run time, however, the JVM invokes mailCheck() in the Salary class.
