if something fails it happens immediately and visibly

 C++ V.S. Java
https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/cpp-vs-java/
flaws of CPP:
1. not portable
2. developers have FULL control of memory management - cause trouble
                                                     - misuse of pointers

 Java Design：
 1. Portable
        - JDK JRE JVM(sandbox)
 2. Set restrictions (simple to use)
        - Memory Management - OOP - strict methodology (avoid developers breaks code for other users)
        - GC
        - show warnings to prevent/alart when developers are making memory management vulnerability

To Keep It Simple:
1. pass by value - c++ can pass by reference
2. not support multiple inheritance
3. OOP - everything is an object
4. ONLY method overloading is allowed - operator overloading is NOT allowed (1 + 1 can be anything in cpp)
5. ALL non-static methods by default can be overridden, static method CANNOT be override
6. Build-in thread support with a class “thread”, can be inheritanced
7. Java is stricted object-oriented, even it supports lambda function after Java8, which is procedural function,
   but only for limited use as
8. NO "goto" function


0. Summeraize language properties
1） In Java, once a variable type has been declared, it cannot be changed.
    Type of declared variable CANNOT be changed.
