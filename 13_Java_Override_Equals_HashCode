There's no such thing as a transient object.
There are transient fields, which are
ignored during serialization - but that has no effect on garbage collection.

transient is a variables modifier used in serialization.
At the time of serialization, if we don’t want to save value
of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.
When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original
value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.

transient is a Java keyword which marks a member variable
not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes.
